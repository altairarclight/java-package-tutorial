# java-package-tutorial
This is a Java package created by following a [tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/QandE/packages-questions.html) on Oracle docs.

## What is this?
Server.java, Client.java, Utilities.jave were originally three separate files that did not belong to a package. Code was added to each file so that they become part of a Java package. The packages `mygame.server`, `mygame.client`, `mygame.shared` were then compiled and uploaded to this repo.

## Why is this here?
Keep track of progress towards larger-scaled software projects.

## Running the Program
1. Download this repository
2. Go into this repo's root directory
3. Run `java mygame.server.Server`

This should launch a server on `localhost:4444`. After opening this port in the browser, some output will be shown in the terminal.
